| Companies keep records of cellphone locations              | I support the idea of companies keeping track of cellphone locations. This location is extremely useful for finding missing people after emergencies, such as crashing a car in Tanya's case. While the user does lose privacy, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and several laws prevent law enforcement from obtaining this private information without a warrant                                                                                                                                                                                                                |    1 |

| "It's all just bits"                                       | While technically it is all just bits, personally I believe we shouldn't think of it as such. Thinking of computers in terms of bits is like thinking of writing in terms of graphite. While all handwritten work is technically just graphite on paper, its really much more than that. We think of writing in terms of words, phrases, paragraphs, and should think of the computer experience in terms of experiences. Similarly, copyright law is based on text, and so laws pertaining to computers should be based on the computer experience, not what delivers that experience |    5 |

| "In fact, processors have hardly grown faster at all"      | Considering the next sentence is talking about "multiple processors on the same chip" I assume this statement is talking about the processor cores themselves. However, data shows that the fastest processors today (AMD Epyc) are about 80 times faster in terms of single core performance, something I wouldn't personally classify as "hardly." Still, its true that processor cores have increased over the years (from single core chips to server chips with over 128 cores in the span of just 20 years).                                                                     |    8 |

| "By 2011, we may be producing more bits than we can store" | I found this statement the most interesting in this chapter. We've made leaps and bounds in storage technology since then, nowadays you can buy tens of terabytes of strorage for quite cheap, compared to the expensive "high end" 80gb drives you could get in 2008, back when the book released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   10 |
