* Choose one of the lenses with the best question which you have created. Read a few articles on the topic, and for two articles do the following:
** Article 1: [[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5][The fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham science]]
1. Brief summary of the article
   - Since last January, journals have retracted at least 370 papers that have
     been publicly linked to paper mills. Many more retractions are expected to
     follow; 15 are still under investigation. Research-integrity sleuths have
     warned that some scientists buy papers from third-party firms to help their
     careers. Image detectives who work under pseudonyms posted a list of more
     than 400 published papers they said probably came from a paper mill in
     January 2020. By March 2021, they had collectively listed more than 1,300
     articles as possibly coming from paper mills. Around 26% of the articles
     that the sleuths alleged came from paper Mills have so far been retracted
     or labeled with expressions of concern.

2. Authors Thesis:
   - Research-integrity sleuths have repeatedly warned that some scientists buy
     papers from third-party firms to help their careers

3. To what extent are the authors claims valid?
   - The authors claims are valid, as the company publishing this article
     (Nature), deals with peer-reviewing and publishing research papers like
     these every day. The claims of the article are not only backed up by the
     company's experience, but also anecdotes from other publishers and
     researchers, who have been cited in the article

4. What is one weakness with the author's claim?
   -

5. Copy and paste 2 direct quotes that best represent this article .
   - In a statement this year to Nature, Elsevier said that its journal editors
     detect and prevent the publication of thousands of probable paper-mill
     submissions each year, although some do get through.

     - We are one of a number of publishers to have been affected by such
       activity.” Since last January, journals have retracted at least 370
       papers that have been publicly linked to paper mills, an analysis by
       Nature has found, and many more retractions are expected to follow.

6. Evaluate the article's effectiveness. Is it convincing?
   - The article is convincing. The write is objective, to the point, and makes
     sure to back up her writing with sources and citations. The site itself is
     trustworthy, /nature.com/ is a host to many research papers and is
     experienced on the topic.

7. Do you agree with the author?
   - I completely agree with the author.  Companies who churn out fake
     manuscripts are a disgrace to science, and harm the work of other students
     and researchers who worked hard to produce original work.

8. Create an MLA works cited entry for each article:
   - Else, Holly, and Richard Van Noorden. “The Fight against Fake-Paper
   Factories That Churn out Sham Science.” Nature, vol. 591, no. 7851, Mar.
   2021, pp. 516–19. www.nature.com, https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00733-5.

** Article 2:  [[https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx][A Collaboration Between two Artists: One Human, One a Machine]]
 1. Brief summary of the article
    - Christie's becomes the first auction house to offer a work of art created by an algorithm. Portrait of Edmond Belamy was created by Paris-based
      collective Obvious. It is one of a group of portraits of the fictional
      Belamy family created by Hugo Caselles-Dupré. The AI-generated artwork
      sells for $432,500, nearly 45 times its high estimate.

 2. Authors Thesis:
    - This portrait, however, is not the product of a human mind. It was created
      by an artificial intelligence, an algorithm defined by that algebraic
      formula with its many parentheses

 3. To what extent are the authors claims valid?
    - The author's claims are somewhat valid. Although the author is
      experienced on the subject, he does not attempt to speak objectively

 4. What is one weakness with the author's claim?
 5. Copy and paste 2 direct quotes that best represent this article
 6. Evaluate the article's effectiveness. Is it convincing?
 7. Do you agree with the author?
 8. Create an MLA works cited entry for each article
