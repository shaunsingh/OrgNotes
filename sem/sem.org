* Choose one of the lenses with the best question which you have created. Read a few articles on the topic, and for two articles do the following:
** Article 1: [[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5][The fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham science]]
1. Brief summary of the article
   - Since last January, journals have retracted at least 370 papers that have
     been publicly linked to paper mills. Many more retractions are expected to
     follow; 15 are still under investigation. Research-integrity sleuths have
     warned that some scientists buy papers from third-party firms to help their
     careers. Image detectives who work under pseudonyms posted a list of more
     than 400 published papers they said probably came from a paper mill in
     January 2020. By March 2021, they had collectively listed more than 1,300
     articles as possibly coming from paper mills. Around 26% of the articles
     that the sleuths alleged came from paper Mills have so far been retracted
     or labeled with expressions of concern.

2. Authors Thesis:
   - Research-integrity sleuths have repeatedly warned that some scientists buy
     papers from third-party firms to help their careers

3. To what extent are the authors claims valid?
   - The authors claims are valid, as the company publishing this article
     (Nature), deals with peer-reviewing and publishing research papers like
     these every day. The claims of the article are not only backed up by the
     company's experience, but also anecdotes from other publishers and
     researchers, who have been cited in the article

4. What is one weakness with the author's claim?
   -

5. Copy and paste 2 direct quotes that best represent this article .
   - In a statement this year to Nature, Elsevier said that its journal editors
     detect and prevent the publication of thousands of probable paper-mill
     submissions each year, although some do get through.

   - We are one of a number of publishers to have been affected by such
       activity.” Since last January, journals have retracted at least 370
       papers that have been publicly linked to paper mills, an analysis by
       Nature has found, and many more retractions are expected to follow.

6. Evaluate the article's effectiveness. Is it convincing?
   - The article is convincing. The write is objective, to the point, and makes
     sure to back up her writing with sources and citations. The site itself is
     trustworthy, /nature.com/ is a host to many research papers and is
     experienced on the topic.

7. Do you agree with the author?
   - I completely agree with the author.  Companies who churn out fake
     manuscripts are a disgrace to science, and harm the work of other students
     and researchers who worked hard to produce original work.

8. Create an MLA works cited entry for each article:
   - Else, Holly, and Richard Van Noorden. “The Fight against Fake-Paper
   Factories That Churn out Sham Science.” Nature, vol. 591, no. 7851, Mar.
   2021, pp. 516–19. www.nature.com, https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00733-5.

** Article 2:  [[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2017.00075/full][A Review of Future and Ethical Perspectives of Robotics and AI]]
 1. Brief summary of the article
    - Authors and movie makers have been actively predicting how the future
      would look with the appearance of advanced technology. Recently, business
      leaders and academics have warned that advances in AI may have major
      consequences for society. Both sides could do well to learn from each
      other

 2. Authors Thesis:
    -  This article reviews work considering both the future potential of
      robotics and AI systems, and ethical considerations that need to be taken
      in order to avoid a dystopian future.

 3. To what extent are the authors claims valid?
    - The author's claims are very valid. The author is experienced in the
      subject and researches the subject at a prestigious university. The paper
      is published under a well known publishing firm with a .org address. The
      author also cites all his sources, which are from reputable authors and firms

 4. What is one weakness with the author's claim?
    - One weakness with the author's claim is that it does not reference
      information that could be classified as coming from experts in the field.
      For example, the United Nations has several policies and releases several
      articles that concern the authors chosen subject. Something of a similar
      nature would be ideal.

 5. Copy and paste 2 direct quotes that best represent this article
    - The technological transition from industrial robots to service robots
      represents an evolution into more personalized systems with an increasing
      degree of autonomy.
    -  Ethical considerations should be taken into account by designers of
      robotic and AI systems, and the autonomous systems themselves must also be aware of ethical implications of their actions.

 6. Evaluate the article's effectiveness. Is it convincing?
    - The article is convincing. The write is objective, to the point, and makes
     sure to back up her writing with sources and citations. The site itself is
     trustworthy experienced on the topic.

 7. Do you agree with the author?
    -  I agree with the authors claim. The author takes into account several
      ethical implications that prove the claim to be correct. Additionally, the
      author's mention of transition from industrial to service robots connects
      directly to the field of study. This helps support the claim made earlier.

 8. Create an MLA works cited entry for each article
    - Torresen, Jim. “A Review of Future and Ethical Perspectives of Robotics
      and AI.” Frontiers in Robotics and AI, vol. 4, 2018, p. 75. Frontiers,
      https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2017.00075.
