\section{Choose one of the lenses with the best question which you have created. Read a few articles on the topic, and for two articles do the following:}
\label{sec:orgbaa476e}
\subsection{Article 1: \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5}{The fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham science}}
\label{sec:orgcaa1464}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Brief summary of the article
\begin{itemize}
\item Since last January, journals have retracted at least 370 papers that have
been publicly linked to paper mills. Many more retractions are expected to
follow; 15 are still under investigation. Research-integrity sleuths have
warned that some scientists buy papers from third-party firms to help their
careers. Image detectives who work under pseudonyms posted a list of more
than 400 published papers they said probably came from a paper mill in
January 2020. By March 2021, they had collectively listed more than 1,300
articles as possibly coming from paper mills. Around 26\% of the articles
that the sleuths alleged came from paper Mills have so far been retracted
or labeled with expressions of concern.
\end{itemize}

\item Authors Thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Research-integrity sleuths have repeatedly warned that some scientists buy
papers from third-party firms to help their careers
\end{itemize}

\item To what extent are the authors claims valid?

\item What is one weakness with the author's claim?
\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Copy and paste 2 direct quotes that best represent this article .
\begin{itemize}
\item In a statement this year to Nature, Elsevier said that its journal editors detect and prevent the publication of thousands of probable paper-mill submissions each year, although some do get through.

\begin{itemize}
\item We are one of a number of publishers to have been affected by such activity.” Since last January, journals have retracted at least 370 papers that have been publicly linked to paper mills, an analysis by Nature has found, and many more retractions are expected to follow.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluate the article's effectiveness. Is it convincing?
\begin{itemize}
\item The article is convincing. The write is objective, to the point, and makes
sure to back up her writing with sources and citations. The site itself is
trustworthy, \emph{nature.com} is a host to many research papers and is
experienced on the topic.
\end{itemize}

\item Do you agree with the author?
\begin{itemize}
\item I completely agree with the author.  Companies who churn out fake
manuscripts are a disgrace to science, and harm the work of other students
and researchers who worked hard to produce original work.
\end{itemize}

\item Create an MLA works cited entry for each article:
\begin{itemize}
\item Else, Holly, and Richard Van Noorden. “The Fight against Fake-Paper
\end{itemize}
Factories That Churn out Sham Science.” Nature, vol. 591, no. 7851, Mar.
2021, pp. 516–19. www.nature.com, \url{https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00733-5}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Article 2:  \href{https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx}{A Collaboration Between two Artists: One Human, One a Machine}}
\label{sec:orgfdb7d05}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Brief summary of the article
\begin{itemize}
\item Christie's becomes the first auction house to offer a work of art created by an algorithm. Portrait of Edmond Belamy was created by Paris-based
collective Obvious. It is one of a group of portraits of the fictional
Belamy family created by Hugo Caselles-Dupré. The AI-generated artwork
sells for \$432,500, nearly 45 times its high estimate.
\end{itemize}

\item Authors Thesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item This portrait, however, is not the product of a human mind. It was created by an artificial intelligence, an algorithm defined by that algebraic formula with its many parentheses
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To what extent are the authors claims valid?
\item What is one weakness with the author's claim?
\item Copy and paste 2 direct quotes that best represent this article
\item Evaluate the article's effectiveness. Is it convincing?
\item Do you agree with the author?
\item Create an MLA works cited entry for each article
\end{enumerate}
\end{document}
