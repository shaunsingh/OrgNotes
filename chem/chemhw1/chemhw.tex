\section{Summer Assignment 1}
\label{sec:org997b19f}
\subsection{How many significant figures are there each of the following values}
\label{sec:orgb81734e}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(0.002330\) has \textbf{4} significant figures. Since the leading zeroes (those before the 2) don't count, the significant figures consist of \(2330\), or 4 significant figures.
\item \(13.00\) has \textbf{4} significant figures. Since all non-zero digits are significant (the 13) as well as all digits after the decimal, every digit in this number is significant, giving us 4 significant figures.
\item \(322.1221\) has \textbf{7} significant figures. Since all non-zero digits are significant, every digit in this number is significant. That gives us 7 significant figures.
\item \(1204.30\) has \textbf{6} significant figures. Since all non-zero digits are significant (the 12 4.3) as well as all digits after the decimal and zeroes between non-zero digits, every digit in this number is significant, giving us 6 significant figures.
\item \(0.0002\) has \textbf{1} significant figure. Since all leading zeroes (those before the 2) don't count, the significant figures consist of just the 2, which means it has only 1 significant figure.
\item \(2200.0\) has \textbf{5} significant figures. Since all non-zero digits (the 22) as well as zeroes before and after the decimal point are sig figs, all 5 digits are significant figures.
\item \(0.0331120\) has \textbf{6} significant figures. Since all non-zero digits (33112) as well as the zeroes after the non-zero digits are significant figures, there are 6 significant figures.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Perform the indicated calculations on the following measured values, giving the final answer with the correct number of significant figures.}
\label{sec:org0fede97}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(16.81 + 3.2257 = 20.0357 \approx 20.04\)
\item \(324.6 * 815.991 = 264870.6786 \approx 264900\)
\item \(2.85 + 3.4621 + 1.3 = 7.6121 \approx 7.6\)
\item \(7.442 - 7.429 = 0.013\)
\item \(1.65 * 14 = 23.1 \approx 23\)
\item \(\frac{27}{4.148} = 6.509161 \approx 6.5\)
\item \([\frac{(3.901 - 3.887)}{3.901}] * 1.00 = [\frac{0.014}{3.901}] * 1.00 \approx 0.0036 * 1.00 = 0.0036\)
\item \(6.404 * 2.91 * (18.7 - 17.1) = 6.404 * 2.91 * 1.6 \approx 30\)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A sample of motor oil with a mass of 440 g occupies 500 mL. What is the density of the motor oil?}
\label{sec:orge81487d}
We have the following values:
\begin{align*}
&d = ?\\
&m = 440g\\
&v = 500mL
\end{align*}
We can utilize the formula \(d=\frac{m}{v}\) (density = mass/volume)
\begin{align*}
d&=\frac{m}{v}\\
&=\frac{440g}{500mL}\\
&=0.88\frac{g}{mL}\\
&\approx0.9\frac{g}{mL}
\end{align*}
Therefore the density of the motor oil is \(\approx0.9\frac{g}{mL}\)

\subsection{The density of an object is 16.3 g/mL. Its volume is 0.125 L. What is the mass of the object?}
\label{sec:org5714fb5}
We can apply vector analysis to solve for the correct units
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
16.3g & 1000 mL\\
\midrule
1mL & 1L\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We are left with
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{16.3g * 1000mL}{(mL)(L)}\\
&= \frac{16.3g * 1000\xout{mL}}{\xout{(mL)}(L)}\\
&= \frac{16300g}{(L)}\\
&= 16300g/L
\end{align*}
Now we have the following values:
\begin{align*}
&d = 16300g/L\\
&m = \ ?\\
&v = 0.125L
\end{align*}
We can plug these variables into \(d=\frac{m}{v}\) to calculate for mass
\begin{align*}
16300{g}/{L} &=\frac{m}{0.125L}\\
\end{align*}
Re-arranging the equation in terms of mass, we get the following
\begin{align*}
m &= 16300 * 0.125\ \frac{g\xout{L}}{\xout{L}}\\
&= 2037.5g\\
&\approx 2040g
\end{align*}
The mass of the object is \(\approx 2040g\)

\subsection{A sample of uranium weighing 30.923 g was dropped in a graduated cylinder containing 22.30 mL of water. The volume of the water plus the sample was 23.90 mL. What is the density of uranium?}
\label{sec:orgfec0ce8}
The volume of the object is going to be the difference between the volume of the water and the volume of the water + object.
\begin{equation}
23.90mL - 22.30mL = 1.60mL
\end{equation}
Now we have the following values:
\begin{align*}
&d = ?\\
&m = 30.923g\\
&v = 1.60mL
\end{align*}
We can apply the same \(d=\frac{m}{v}\) to calculate for density
\begin{align*}
d&=\frac{m}{v}\\
            &=\frac{30.923g}{1.60mL}\\
            &=19.33\frac{g}{mL}\\
            &\approx19.3\frac{g}{mL}
\end{align*}
Uranium has a density of \(\approx19.3\frac{g}{mL}\)

\subsection{How many protons, neutrons and electrons are in each of the following ions?}
\label{sec:org4c6f44d}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ion will have \textbf{26 protons}, since the atomic number is 26. It will also have \textbf{30 neutrons} since the mass \# is 56, and \(56-26=30\). Since it has a 3+ charge, there will be 3 more protons than electrons. \(26-3=23\), giving us \textbf{23 electrons}.
\item The ion will have \textbf{20 protons}, since the atomic number is 20. It will also have \textbf{20 neutrons} since the mass \# is 40, and \(40-20 = 20\). Since the charge is 2+, there will be 2 more protons than electrons, and \(20-2=18\), giving us \textbf{18 electrons}
\item The ion will have \textbf{9 protons}, since the atomic number is 9. It will also have \textbf{10 neutrons} since the mass \# is 19, and \(18-9=10\). Since the charge is 1-, there will be one more electron than proton. \(9+1=10\), giving us \textbf{10 electrons}
\item The ion will have \textbf{15 protons} since the atomic number is 15. It will also have \textbf{16 neutrons}, since the mass \# is 31, and \(31-15=16\). Since the charge is 3-, there will be 3 more electrons than protons. \(15+3=18\), giving us \textbf{18 electrons}
\item The ion will have \textbf{53 protons}, since the atomic number is 53. It will also have \textbf{74 neutrons}, since the mass \# is 127, and \(127-53=74\). Since the charge is 1-, there will be 1 more electron than protons. \(53+1=54\), giving us \textbf{54 electrons}.
\item The ion will have \textbf{53 protons}, since the atomic number is 53. It will also have \textbf{74 neutrons}, since the mass \# is 127, and \(127-53=74\). Since the charge is 7+, there will be 7 more protons than electrons. \(53-7=46\), giving us \textbf{46 electrons}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Given the position in the periodic table, what is the most likely oxidation state (or common ion charge) that each element will have when forming an ion?}
\label{sec:org298c5d1}

\item \(\ce{S}\) has a 2- oxidation state
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Would you expect the following atoms to gain or lose electrons when forming an ion? If so, how many would be gained or lost?}
\label{sec:orgdbd42c0}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\ce{Be}\) is in Group 2, therefore it will lose 2 electrons
\item \(\ce{Cl}\) is in Group 17, therefore it will gain 1 electron
\item \(\ce{Al}\) is in Group 13, therefore it will lose 3 electrons
\item \(\ce{O}\) is in Group 16, therefore it will gain 2 electrons
\item \(\ce{F}\) is in Group 17, therefore it will gain 1 electron
\item \(\ce{Li}\) is in Group 1, therefore it will lose 1 electron

\subsection{Which of the following particulate diagrams best shows the formation of water vapor from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas in a rigid container at 125\textdegree{} C?}
\label{sec:org5290575}
The correct answer would be \textbf{C}. Both Oxygen and Hydrogen exist freely as molecules with two atoms each, which eliminates options A and B. As the chemical composition of water is \(\ce{H2O}\), there need to be twice as many hydrogen molecules as oxygen molecules, and so C is the only answer that makes sense.

\label{sec:orgfb62db9}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Which of the following diagrams best helps to explain the difference in boiling point of the two compounds?}

The answer is \textbf{B}, since it best shows the difference between hydrogen bonds.

\item \textbf{Describe your reasoning for selecting the answer you did and specifically identify the type of intermolecular forces represented.}

Dimethyl either consists of dipole-dipole interactions or dispersion forces, whereas Ethanol consists of hydrogen bonds, and diagram B best highlights that.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Shown below are three models that can be used to represent a molecule of ammonia. Select one of the models. Each model has its pros and cons.}
\label{sec:org85e7cd0}
I chose to compare the benefits and drawbacks of the \textbf{lewis structure} model.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{One aspect of the ammonia molecule that the model represents accurately/well}

The Lewis structure model allows the reader to easily see where all the electrons are, as well as if each atom obeys the octet rule. You can also which electrons are bonding, as well as which electrons are non-bonding and lone pairs.

\item \textbf{One aspect of the ammonia molecule that the model does not represent accurately/well.}

It is difficult to show resonance structures with a lewis structure. There is also a lack of 3 dimensional modeling with the lewis structure. Lewis structures only imply shape, in order to find the 3 dimensional shape of a molecule, you have to use other knowledge, using VSEPR.
