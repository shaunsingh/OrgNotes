* Why did Mexico give land to Moses Austin?
Mexico gave land to Moses Austin to encourage economic development
* Why did Mexico ban further emigration into Texas?
Austin's son made a small profit selling land to other Americans, and soon
enough 7,000 americans moved in. This made Mexico nervious, and so they anulled
the land contracts

The Texans first and foremost wanted to own slaves, and wanted to make
everythign English, or "Americanized." They refused to learn Spanish, and didn't
accept their religion or culture
