  1. When energy is converted from one form to the other, its conserved, not
     destroyed
  2. Situations of lower energy are more stable and are favored over situations
     of higher energy, which are less stable
  3. The energy you exert to lift a weight gives it potential energy
  4. Due to electrostatic forces, opposite charges attract, and like charges repel
