#+title: The Central Theme in Chemistry
Understanding the properties of a substance and the changes it undergoes leads
to the central theme in chemistry
- [[id:2b2315bd-4f5c-44b0-be57-9dbf540bc0e7][Macroscopic]]-scale properties and behavior, those we can see, are the results
  of atomic-scale properties, those we can't see
- We study /observable/ changes in matter to understand their /unobservable/ causes
