- No change in composition.
- occurs when a substance alters only its physical properties
** Physical properties
    - characteristics a substance shows by itself, without changing into or
      interacting with another substance

* Chemical change

    - change in composition
    - also called a chemical reaction
    - occurs when one or more substances are converted into one or more
      substances with different composition and properties.
** Chemical property
    - characteristics a substance shows as it changes into or interacts with
      another substance
    - includes flammability, corrosiveness, and reactivity with acids

* Temperature and Changes in Matter

- Depending on the temperature and pressure of the surroundings, many substances
  can exist in each of the three physical states, and undergo changes in state
  as well.
- For example, as the temperature increases, solid water melts to liquid water,
  which boils into gaseous water, which is a [[id:637dabef-ee83-4838-a1b5-588b96cd447f][Physical change]]
