#+title: Introduction of guns/germs/horses to the Native Americans
* Introductions of guns/germs/horse to the Native Americans
** Guns
    Native Americans now have advanced weaponry. Although this is better than
    their current weaponry (spears, bows, etc), Native Americans are still going
    to be unfamiliar with how to use such powerful weapons. Overall this is a
    benefit.

** Germs
    Native Americans contract the diseases brought over from settlers, mostly
    from Britain. Because of this, they don't have the antibodies needed to
    fight those diseases greatly decreasing the Native American population. This
    is a setback for the Natives.
** Horse
    Horse's offer quicker transportation for the Natives. Quicker transportation
    means easier contact with other tribes, as well as quicker access to
    "modern" civilization. This is a benefit for the native Americans
