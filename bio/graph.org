* Pre-Lab Discussion
1. Would a line graph or a bar graph be better for showing the number of birds
   of each color in a population?
   - A Bar Graph would be better, as the data is grouped data.
2. How could you plot more than one responding variable on a line graph?
   - You could plot two lines on one graph.
3. Where do you place the manipulated variable on a line graph?
   - The manipulated (independant) variable goes on the X-axis.
4. Which type of graph would you use to show comparisons? Explain the reason for your answer.
   - I would use a Pie Chart, as its effective in showing parts of a whole. If
     you wan't a precise comparison (as opposed to a relative one), use a bar graph
5. Why is it important to have all parts of a graph clearly labeled and drawn?
   - Graphs that are clearly labeled are much less likely to be misread or misinterpreted.

* Procedure
** Part A: Interpreting Graphs
1. No answer required
2. Use the line graph in Figure 2 to answer the following questions
   a. Which plant grew the tallest
      - Plant 2
   b. How many plants grew to be at least 6 cm tall?
      - All 3 plants grew to be atleast 6cm tall
   c. Which plant grew the fastest in the first five days?
      - Plant 3 grew the fastest the first 5 days
   d. Which line represents plant 2?
      - The dotted (----) line represents plant 2
   e. After 10 days, how much had plant 3 grown?
      - After 10 days plant 3 was 6cm tall
   f. How long did it take for plant 1 to grow 6 cm?
      - It took 15 days for plant 1 to reach 6cm
3. No answer required
4. Use the bar graph to answer the following questions
   a. At birth, what is the average number of red blood cells per mm of blood?
      - At birth, there are 5.7 million blood cells/mm$^{3}$ on average
   b. What appears to happen to the number of red blood cells between birth and 2 months?
      - The number of red blood cells drastically decresaes between birth and 2 months
   c. What happens to the number of red blood cells between the ages of 6 and 8 years?
      - From 6 to 8 years, the number of red blood cells stays the same
   d. Between what ages is a human likely to have 4.6 million red blood cells?
      - Someone is likely to have 4.6 million red blood cells from 6-12 months of age
   e. After 14 years of age, do males or females have a higher red blood cell count?
      - After 14 years of age, males have a higher blood cell count

** Part B: Constructing Graphs
*** Data Table 1:
Use the information recorded in Data Table 1 to construct a line
graph on the grid provided below. You should label each axis, mark an appropriate scale on each axis, plot the data, connect the points,
and give your graph a title

#+plot: title:"Effect of temperature on rate of breathing"  file:"temperatureVSbreathing.jpeg" set:"xlabel 'Temperature (C\deg)'" set:"ylabel 'Breathing Rate (Per Minute)'" ind:1 type:2d deps:(2)
| Temperature(C) | Breathing Rate (Per Minute) |
|----------------+-----------------------------|
|             10 |                          15 |
|----------------+-----------------------------|
|             15 |                          25 |
|----------------+-----------------------------|
|             18 |                          30 |
|----------------+-----------------------------|
|             38 |                          60 |
|----------------+-----------------------------|
|             57 |                          25 |

*** Data Table 2:
Use the information recorded in Data Table 2 to construct a bar graph
on the grid provided below. You should label each axis, mark an appropriate
scale on each axis, plot the data, darken the columns of the graph, and give
your graph a title.

#+plot: title:"Average Rainfall in Willamette Valley" ind:1 deps:(2) type:2d file:"averagerainfall.jpeg" with:histograms set:"yrange [0:]" set:"xlabel 'Month'" set:"ylabel 'Rainfall (mL)'"
| Month | Rainfall (mL) |
|-------+---------------|
| Jan.  |            15 |
| Feb.  |            21 |
| Mar.  |            28 |
| April |            24 |
| May   |            16 |
| June  |             8 |
| July  |             2 |
| Aug.  |             1 |
| Sept  |             2 |
| Oct.  |             3 |
| Nov.  |             5 |
| Dec.  |            10 |

* Analysis and Conclusions
1. *Comparing and Contrasting:* How is a graph similar to a data table?
   - Graphs and table are similar because they both present the evidential and
     statistic data given and yielded from a certain experiment or testing. They
     both have a role in classification, categorization, interpretation and
     organization of the data. A table presents the raw data, while a graph
     visualizes it

2. *Comparing and Contrasting:* How is a line graph different from a bar graph?
   - Bar graphs show data with blocks of different lengths, whereas line graphs
     show a series of points connected by straight lines. Bar graphs are more
     versatile while line graphs are better for showing trends over time or
     another measure with a logical progression of values. Bar graphs can also
     show frequency distributions much more effectively than line graphs.

3. *Using Graphs:* Does a steep curve on a line graph indicate a rapid or slow
   rate of change?
   - A steep curve on a line graph would indicate a rapid rate of change

4. *Using Graphs:* You are conducting an experiment to measure the gain in mass of
   a young mouse over a ten-week period. In constructing a graph to represent
   your data, which variable should you place along the x-axis and which
   variable should you place along the y-axis? Explain your answer.
   - On the x-axis you would put the independent/manipulated variable, which is
     the time. On the y-axis is the dependant variable, which is the gain in
     mass.

5. *Using Graphs:* What is an advantage of using multiple lines in a line graph?
   (See Figure 2.)
   - With multiple lines, you can display multiple sets of data, allowing the
     reader to easily compare and contrast the datasets.
