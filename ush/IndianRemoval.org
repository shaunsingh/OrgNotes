* How did the Cherokees assimilate to U.S. values and cultures
Many indian groups rejected assimilation and resisted the enroachment of white
settlers. Other groups adopted some parts of Anglo-American culture. For
example, the Cherokees in Georgia created a rupublic with a government similar
to that of the United State's. Cherokees also supported and participated in
cotton trade, and eventually adopted a constitution considering themselves a
nation.


* Why didn't the U.S. government view the Cherokees as a success story of assimilation between U.S. and Native cultures?
The Cherokee eventually declared independance and the American's disagreed with
that. The Americans also wanted the Cherokee's land, which was now off limits.
