\section{Summer Assignment 1}
\label{sec:org254ad55}
\subsection{How many significant figures are there each of the following values}
\label{sec:orgbaa55c0}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 4 significant figures
\item 4 significant figures
\item 7 significant figures
\item 6 significant figures
\item 1 significant figures
\item 5 significant figures
\item 6 significant figures
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Perform the indicated calculations on the following measured values, giving the final answer with the correct number of significant figures.}
\label{sec:org3278ffb}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(16.81 + 3.2257 = 20.0357 \approx 20.04\)
\item \(324.6 * 815.991 = 264870.6786 \approx 264900\)
\item \(2.85 + 3.4621 + 1.3 = 7.6121 \approx 7.6\)
\item \(7.442 - 7.429 = 0.013\)
\item \(1.65 * 14 = 23.1 \approx 23\)
\item \(\frac{27}{4.148} = 6.509161 \approx 6.5\)
\item \([\frac{(3.901 - 3.887)}{3.901}] * 1.00 = [\frac{0.014}{3.901}] * 1.00 = 0.0036 * 1.00 = 0.0036\)
\item \(6.404 * 2.91 * (18.7 - 17.1) = 6.404 * 2.91 * 1.6 \approx 30\)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A sample of motor oil with a mass of 440 g occupies 500 mL. What is the density of the motor oil?}
\label{sec:org332e230}
We can utilize the formula \(d=\frac{m}{v}\) (density = mass/volume)
\begin{align*}
d&=\frac{m}{v}\\
&=\frac{440g}{500mL}\\
&=0.88\frac{g}{mL}\\
&\approx0.9\frac{g}{mL}
\end{align*}

\subsection{The density of an object is 16.3 g/mL. Its volume is 0.125 L. What is the mass of the object?}
\label{sec:org080cc14}
We can apply vector analysis to solve for the correct units
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
16.3g & 1000 mL\\
\hline
1mL & 1L\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{align*}
=16300{g}/{L}
\end{align*}
We can apply the same \(d=\frac{m}{v}\) to calculate for mass
\begin{equation}
16300{g}/{L}=\frac{m}{0.125mL}
\end{equation}
Re-arranging the equation in terms of mass, we get the following
\begin{align*}
m &= 16300 * 0.125\\
&= 2037.5g\\
&\approx 2040g
\end{align*}

\subsection{A sample of uranium weighing 30.923 g was dropped in a graduated cylinder containing 22.30 mL of water. The volume of the water plus the sample was 23.90 mL. What is the density of uranium?}
\label{sec:orgbdfb8e6}
The volume of the object is going to be the difference between the volume of the water and the volume of the water + object.
\begin{equation}
23.90mL - 22.30mL = 1.60mL
\end{equation}
We can apply the same \(d=\frac{m}{v}\) to calculate for density
\begin{align*}
d&=\frac{m}{v} \\
            &=\frac{30.923g}{1.60mL}\\
            &=19.33\frac{g}{mL}\\
            &\approx19.3\frac{g}{mL}
\end{align*}

\subsection{How many protons, neutrons and electrons are in each of the following ions?}
\label{sec:org13a51c6}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Protons = 26. Neutrons = 30. Electrons = 23
\item Protons = 20. Neutrons = 20. Electrons = 18
\item Protons = 9. Neutrons = 10. Electrons = 10
\item Protons = 15. Neutrons = 16. Electrons = 18
\item Protons = 53. Neutrons = 74. Electrons = 54
\item Protons = 53. Neutrons = 74. Electrons = 46
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Given the position in the periodic table, what is the most likely oxidation state (or common ion charge) that each element will have when forming an ion?}
\label{sec:orgd8c4bf8}

\subsection{Would you expect the following atoms to gain or lose electrons when forming an ion? If so, how many would be gained or lost?}
\label{sec:org1def4ac}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\ce{Be}\) is in Group 2, therefore it will lose 2 electrons (and have a +2 charge)
\item \(\ce{Cl}\) is in Group 17, therefore it will gain 1 electron (and have a -1 charge)
\item \(\ce{Al}\) is in group 13, therefore it will gain 5 electrons (and have a -5 charge)
\item \(\ce{O}\) is in group 16, therefore it will gain 8 electrons (and have a -2 charge)
\item \(\ce{F}\) is in group 17, therefore it will gain 1 electron (and have a -1 charge)
\item \(\ce{Li}\) is in group 1, therefore it will lose 1 electron (and have a +1 charge)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Name each of the following compounds:}
\label{sec:org66137d1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\ce{PbI2}\) is named as Lead(II) iodide
\item \(\ce{NH4Cl}\) is named as Ammonium chloride
\item \(\ce{Fe2O3}\) is named as Iron(III) oxide
\item \(\ce{LiH}\) is named as Lithium hydride

\subsection{Which of the following particulate diagrams best shows the formation of water vapor from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas in a rigid container at 125\textdegree{} C?}
\label{sec:org7e5f371}
The correct answer would be \textbf{C}. Both Oxygen and Hydrogen exist freely as molecules with two atoms each, which eliminates options A and B. As the chemical composition of water is \(\ce{H2O}\), there need to be twice as many hydrogen molecules as oxygen molecules, and so C is the only answer that makes sense.

\subsection{Name each of the following compounds. In addition, for the compounds in letters a-c, draw Lewis structures, predict VSEPR geometry and hybridization.}
\label{sec:org68373e8}
\(\ce{NI3}\) is named as Nitrogen triiodide, and has the following Lewis Structure. It has a Trigonal pyramidal shape with 109.5° bond angles, and has a SP3 hybridization
\begin{align}
\chemfig{\charge{90=\:}{N}(-\charge{90=\:, 0:2pt=\:, -90=\:}{I})(-[:-90]\charge{0:2pt=\:, -90=\:, -180:2pt=\:}{I})(-[:-180]\charge{90=\:, -180:2pt=\:, -90=\:}{I})}

\end{align}
\(\ce{CO}\) is named as Carbon monoxide, and has the following Lewis Structure. It has a linear shape with 180\textdegree{} Bond angles, and has a SP hybridization

\chemfig{{C}(-\charge{90=\:, 0:2pt=\:, -90=\:}{Cl})(-[:-90]\charge{0:2pt=\:, -90=\:, -180:2pt=\:}{Cl})(-[:-180]\charge{90=\:, -180:2pt=\:, -90=\:}{Cl})(-[:-270]{H})}

Therefore, the correct option is \textbf{A}. Both options II and III are tetrahedral and trigonal pyramidal respectively. Option I (\(\ce{BCL3}\)) is the only one that has a geometry in one plane (trigonal planar)
