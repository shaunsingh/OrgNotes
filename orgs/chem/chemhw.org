** How many significant figures are there each of the following values
a. 4 significant figures
b. 4 significant figures
c. 7 significant figures
d. 6 significant figures
e. 1 significant figures
f. 5 significant figures
g. 6 significant figures

** Perform the indicated calculations on the following measured values, giving the final answer with the correct number of significant figures.
a. $16.81 + 3.2257 = 20.0357 \approx 20.04$
b. $324.6 * 815.991 = 264870.6786 \approx 264900$
c. $2.85 + 3.4621 + 1.3 = 7.6121 \approx 7.6$
d. $7.442 - 7.429 = 0.013$
e. $1.65 * 14 = 23.1 \approx 23$
f. $\frac{27}{4.148} = 6.509161 \approx 6.5$
g. $[\frac{(3.901 - 3.887)}{3.901}] * 1.00 = [\frac{0.014}{3.901}] * 1.00 = 0.0036 * 1.00 = 0.0036$
h. $6.404 * 2.91 * (18.7 - 17.1) = 6.404 * 2.91 * 1.6 \approx 30$

** A sample of motor oil with a mass of 440 g occupies 500 mL. What is the density of the motor oil?
We have the following values:
\begin{align*}
&d = ?\\
&m = 440g\\
&v = 500mL
\end{align*}
We can utilize the formula $d=\frac{m}{v}$ (density = mass/volume)
\begin{align*}
d&=\frac{m}{v}\\
&=\frac{440g}{500mL}\\
&=0.88\frac{g}{mL}\\
&\approx0.9\frac{g}{mL}
\end{align*}

** The density of an object is 16.3 g/mL. Its volume is 0.125 L. What is the mass of the object?
We can apply vector analysis to solve for the correct units
| 16.3g | 1000 mL |
|-------+---------|
| 1mL   | 1L      |
We are left with
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{16.3g * 1000mL}{(mL)(L)}\\
&= \frac{16.3g * 1000\xout{mL}}{\xout{(mL)}(L)}\\
&= \frac{16300g}{(L)}\\
&\approx 16300g/L
\end{align*}
Now we have the following values:
\begin{align*}
&d = 16300g/L\\
&m = ?\\
&v = 0.125L
\end{align*}
We can plug these variables into $d=\frac{m}{v}$ to calculate for mass
\begin{align*}
16300{g}/{L} &=\frac{m}{0.125L}\\
\end{align*}
Re-arranging the equation in terms of mass, we get the following
\begin{align*}
m &= 16300 * 0.125\ \frac{g\xout{L}}{\xout{L}}\\
&= 2037.5g\\
&\approx 2040g
\end{align*}

** A sample of uranium weighing 30.923 g was dropped in a graduated cylinder containing 22.30 mL of water. The volume of the water plus the sample was 23.90 mL. What is the density of uranium?
The volume of the object is going to be the difference between the volume of the water and the volume of the water + object.
\begin{equation}
23.90mL - 22.30mL = 1.60mL
\end{equation}
Now we have the following values:
\begin{align*}
&d = ?\\
&m = 30.923g\\
&v = 1.60mL
\end{align*}
We can apply the same $d=\frac{m}{v}$ to calculate for density
\begin{align*}
d&=\frac{m}{v} \\
            &=\frac{30.923g}{1.60mL}\\
            &=19.33\frac{g}{mL}\\
            &\approx19.3\frac{g}{mL}
\end{align*}

** Which of the following particulate diagrams best shows the formation of water vapor from hydrogen gas and oxygen gas in a rigid container at 125\deg C?
The correct answer would be *C*. Both Oxygen and Hydrogen exist freely as molecules with two atoms each, which eliminates options A and B. As the chemical composition of water is $\ce{H2O}$, there need to be twice as many hydrogen molecules as oxygen molecules, and so C is the only answer that makes sense.
