Chapter 4, Slavery, Freedom, and the Struggle for the Empire
Equiano

In the mid-1750s, Olaudah Equiano, an 11-year-old son of a West African village chief, was kidnapped, and taken to Barbados, and then sold to a Virginia plantation owner
He went on numerous voyages with his owner, and learned how to read and write in England, and fought in the royal navy

However, he was once again sold and later purchased his freedom, eventually settling in London

There, he published a novel about his life, and described how he was a lucky victim of slavery,
Scholars have argued about where he was born, but in either case, he was a great resource to the investigation as to what slave life was like
Slavery and Empire
More than half of the total Africans imported into the new world were imported during the 18th century

The Atlantic slave trade would later be called a crime against humanity, but at the time it was a regular business.
Every European empire in the New World utilized slave labor and battled for control of the trade
The asiento, an agreement where Spain subcontracted to a foreign power the right to provide slave to Spanish America, was an important prize
Atlantic trade
In the 18th century, the caribbean remained the focus of the British Empire and was the main producer of revenue

However, slave-grown products from the mainland started to grow
Merchants in NY, Massachusetts, and Rohde Island participated often in the slave trade, shipping from and to Africa and the Caribbean
Overall, the Atlantic trade consisted of slaves, crops, and goods destined for slave societies.
Africa and the Slave Trade
Most African rulers took part and actively participated in the slave trade
They controlled the capture of slaves and made sure they were on top
The transatlantic slave trade made Africa a major market for European goods, especially textiles and guns

From a minor institution, slavery grew to become more and more central to West African society
The Middle Passage
the voyage across the Atlantic ocean was known as the Middle Passage
This was because it was the second and middle leg in the triangular trade routes
Since slaves could be sold for twenty to thirty times in America than they were in Africa, men, women, and children were crammed aboard to maximize profits
These living conditions were terrible, and diseases spread rapidly,
About 1 in every 5 slaves died on the trip
Ship captains often threw the sick overboard to prevent the spread of epidemics
Only a small proportion of slaves carried to the New world were destined for NA, most of them went to Brazil or the West Indies
Chesapeake Slavery
By the mid-eighteenth century, three distinct slave systems were well entrenched in Britain’s mainland colonies.
The largest and oldest of these was the tobacco plantation system of the Chesapeake, where more than 270,000 slaves resided in 1770
They supplied England with valuable agricultural products and imported large amounts of British goods
In the 18th century, the growing world demand for tobacco encouraged continued slave imports
As Virginia expanded, so did slavery
In 1770, nearly half of Virginia’s white families owned at least one slave in 1770
Freedom and Slavery in the Chesapeake
Planters filled the law books with measures enhancing the master’s power over his human property and restricting blacks’ access to freedom.
Violence always lay at the heart of the slave system
The race took on more and more an importance
Free black started to lose rights as well
In 1732, Virginia revoked the right to vote for even property-owning free blacks, in order to make a distinction between the offspring and the descendants of an Englishman
Indian Slavery in Early Carolina
Farther south, a different slave system emerged, based on rice production
Local creek Indians in South Carolina started to sell them, slaves, usually who were war criminals and captured captives
However, later on, they felt that they feared enslavement themselves
The Rice Kingdom
The rice kingdom was the introduction of a staple crop, in this case, rice, that led to the large scale importation of slaves and a growing divide between white and blacks
This was often seen in early Virginia and South Carolina
The Georgia Experiment
Rice cultivation also spread into Georgia in the mid-eighteenth century, and soon they decided to ban both slavery and liquor. However, later on, they received backlash, as the colonists fought for their rights and English Liberty, and they quickly won the right to repeal the ban on slavery and liquor once again.
Slave in the north
Compared with the plantation regions, slavery was less central to the economies of New England and the Middle Colonies, where small farms predominated.
Slaves made up only a small percentage of these colonies’ populations, and it was unusual for even rich families to own more than one or two slaves
. Nonetheless, slavery was not marginal to northern colonial life. African slavery existed in New England from the outset, and many of the region’s leaders owned slaves, including the prominent theologian Cotton Mather. Trade with the West Indies was central to the New England economy. N artisan shops, and as stevedores
Slaves worked as farmhands, artisan workers, and faced severe punishments if they didn’t do their work correctly
Slavery was present in new york from the earliest days of the Dutch settlement, and in new york city, ⅕ of the population were slaves
This number only grew as the population increased
In 1770, about 27k slaves lived in New York and New Jersey, 10 percent of their total population
