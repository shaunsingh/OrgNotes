Topic: “Why do We Wait Until the Last Minute?

Learn The Science Behind Procrastination”

Introduction (Reet Jhatta): Hello and welcome back to another podcast! Today we will go deeper into psychological terms. Specifically,  be discussing a problem that several people across the world go through. Whether older or younger, students or adults, many people procrastinate. Procrastination can derive from many reasons, though the internet and technology are actually the most common reasons. According to statistics, the world spends approximately an average of 1.59 hours of internet procrastination. In order to grasp further information, let’s begin!

Sivaditya Padmanabhan: The word procrastination comes from the latin word “procrastinare,” which means to put off till tomorrow. The meaning of this word hasn’t changed all that much over the years and has been pretty consistent in describing our human tendency to put off our work and well… just procrastinate.

Richard Paget: If we’re being honest, we’ve all procrastinated at one point or another in our lives. Whether it be pulling an all-nighter for a project you had weeks to do, putting off a trip to the dentist, or finding a gift for a relative the day of their birthday, we are all guilty of procrastinating in some shape or form. So, why do we wait? And how do we stop waiting?

Sivaditya Padmanabhan: To define the word, ‘procrastination,’ it is the act of delaying an important task or errand, despite knowing that we will suffer the consequence later down the road. It’s odd to think that we sometimes choose to postpone things, even if we know we’re going to have to face the responsibilities later on under a much more time-sensitive circumstance. In simple words, procrastination is that gap between ‘intention’ and ‘action.’

Shaurya Singh: Often, procrastinators make the argument that they “perform better under pressure,” but this is merely an illusion. A study was done back in 1997 by psychologist experts, Dr. Roy Baumeister and Dr. Dianne Tice, at Case Western Reserve University. Baumeister and Tice tracked the performances, stress levels, and overall health of college students throughout the school semester. Initially, procrastinators exhibited lower levels of stress, likely due to the fact that they were putting off their work to pursue more pleasant activities instead. However, these benefits were short-lived, and in the end, those who didn’t procrastinate displayed better academic grades. Ultimately, procrastinators had to perform under stressful time constraints, and as a result, the quality of their work suffered along with their well-being.

Reet Jhatta: If things are pushed until the last minute, people don’t have the luxury of time. As a consequence, important skills that produce ‘quality’ in an assignment, such as pondering and revising your own work, are forced to be left out. Things are rushed, ergo sloppy.

Richard Paget: So, what causes procrastination in the first place? A common perception of procrastination is that it stems from laziness, but this couldn’t stray further away from the truth.

Richard Paget: Science explains that our habits of procrastination originate from 2 conflicting parts of the brain: the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex. The limbic system is a set of structures in the brain that deals with your emotional response and memory. It is one of the most dominant portions of your brain and typically acts out of a subconscious impulse rather than slow and rational thought. On the other hand, the prefrontal cortex deals with decision-making and complex behaviors. You can think of it as your ‘internal planner.’ Now, the prefrontal cortex is much less developed than the limbic system, and when the two fight, the will of the limbic system is what usually comes out on top.

Shaurya Singh: The limbic system is what tells you to pull your hand away from a fire, where you biologically act from your own instinct. This also means that the limbic system focuses on what’s going on in the present moment, and what needs to happen now to make ourselves feel good. This is the neurological explanation for procrastination, where our brains prefer an immediate reward, as we are always given the option to ‘do it tomorrow.’ This is how our brains are wired, where the self-indulgent limbic system promotes the temporary relief that we all crave.

Sivaditya Padmanabhan: With this in mind, are there ways to help out our prefrontal cortex? We want to be kind to our future selves, as they are the ones that bear the burden of having to deal with the consequences of our present selves. We regulate our current mood thinking it will put our future selves in a better state, but this is just false.

Reet Jhatta: There are a couple of tricks we can experiment with to combat procrastination. Although procrastination is a natural, biological process, it can be overcome.

Shaurya Singh: A great first piece of advice is to chop up your work into smaller, more manageable pieces. Procrastinators are often willing to self-impose deadlines for themselves, and it gives them more control over their situation. You can commit to only the first task, and see how you feel afterward. It certainly feels rewarding to come back to a project you’ve already started on, where checking things off your list makes you feel more productive.

Richard Paget: The emotional parts of procrastination pose a different threat, where we find desirable distractions to avoid the given task at hand. Placing your phone in a different room and only keeping open the necessary tabs on your computer are two things that could really make a difference. Although, most procrastinators often lack this trait of ‘self-regulation.’ If you feel like you struggle with this, a good way to resolve these short-term mood fixes is to find something positive or interesting about the task itself. For example, when trying to hammer out that introduction paragraph in an essay, you need to think about what makes the essay worthwhile. You get to express your voice on paper where you get to have an audience, and maybe you can find something positive about the topic you’re writing about. In essence, you need to find that personal meaning inside the task, and why it’s worthy of your attention.

Sivaditya Padmanabhan: If you do feel down or in a bad mood, you are more likely to procrastinate. Studies have shown that people who are in a bad mood and sad are more likely to procrastinate than people in a good mood and who are feeling emotionally well. It is important to understand how you are feeling and manage your work accordingly.

Richard Paget: Moving on, your environment also plays an important role in productivity. Creating a clean workspace releases you from any potential distractions, and it makes you feel more in control of the situation.

Reet Jhatta: Overall, procrastination is a psychological, and quite relatable, phenomenon that we are all guilty of having. Scientists argue that it is the neurological dominance of the limbic system over the prefrontal cortex, where others say that it stems from another complex system of emotions. Nonetheless, you shouldn’t be ashamed if you procrastinate. But people see procrastination as a very relevant problem, where it is constantly chipping away at a most valuable resource: your time. So, if you had to take away one thing from this podcast, let this be a reminder to start your work now! Not tomorrow, or even 5 minutes later today; get yourself to start now!
